# Class: Week Eleven

Questions to answer in your groups:

1. What is the phenomenon that Bridle is describing?

  Using algorithms to churn out content. The role Youtube's algorithms that play in this. 
  The commodification and superficialization of children's media. 

  Farms that flood the market (or Youtube) with slightly modified videos using recycled assets. 

  Keywords thrown together. 

2. What is the underlying structure that makes this possible? (What is the problem here?) Is this a problem of moderation, regulation, or something else? 

  The problem: Lack of control and moderation (Youtube has minimal moderation). The technology is moving faster than what Youtube can meet (algorithmic creation loop[by machines, for who-knows]). All form, no content.

  Structure: the videos are consumed (culture of consumption and mass production). 

    Discoverability --> content leads to other content. 

    No one understands the structure

    Ad revenue. Automated rewards on Youtube. You make money for more views, and Youtube can make money off ads. 

    Google AdSense (cost per click for children's products?)

    Children's products (moral panic? Is this only children's content?)


3. What would a "solution" look like?

    Control what content your kids are exposed to (puts the burden on indiviuals and parents)

    Paywall - people have to pay for the content   
        - moderation means a trade-off with access 
        - there's always a way around

    Regulatory policies, channel investigation?

    The platform benefits. 

    This is both produced and influenced by our culture. 

    Cultural, structural, or regulatory issue?

    Is the algorithmic reward system okay?
