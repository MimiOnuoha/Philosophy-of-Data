# Characteristics of Data

Remember Mitchell Whitelaw's definition: data are measurements taken from the flux of the real. But what does this look like in the real world? 


Here are some useful definitions to terms that you might hear thrown around in regards to data:

+ **MACHINE-READABLE:** Data that can be automatically read and processed by a computer. All machine-readable data is structured. </br> Examples: CSV, JSON, XML

+ **STRUCTURED DATA:** Data where the structural relation between elements is explicit in the way the data is stored on a computer disk. You can think of it as data that's organized, data that can be classified into neat boxes. if something is classified, then that means that computers can work with it really easily.   
Examples: CSV, JSON, XML

+ **HUMAN-READABLE:** Data that is in a format that can be conveniently read by a human. Some structured data is also human-readable, but nearly all unstructured data, by rule, is human-readable. </br>Examples: scans, images, PDFs. 

+ **UNSTRUCTURED:** Data that doesn't have an explicit or pre-defined structure. Multimedia contact, social media data, often text (like text files), images, videos. Anything that's hand-written is unstructured. 
</br> Examples: PDFs, the bodies of email messages, video, audio, digital images. 
  
**Caveats:** Some of these terms are contested. People have argued that the term "unstructured" isn't useful because it implies that the data has no structure, when in fact what it refers to is that the data has a strucutre that data mining tools are not easily able ot parse.

Of course, there *are* ways to deal with unstructured data, and increasingly more are being developed. 


They're all forms data, and there are different programmatic ways to work with it all. And increasingly, we're seeing more structured and semi-structured stuff, and more ways to deal with unstructured things.
