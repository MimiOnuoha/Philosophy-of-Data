'''
Python functions are intended to be short and have a single purpose. 

Take your code from the level-six example and change it so that it is split 
into two different functions. Make at least one of the functions take in 
something as a parameter.  

For help with parameters, see here: http://pythoncentral.io/fun-with-python-function-parameters/

# Parameter example 
def addition(x, y):
	return x + y 

print addition(8,7)
