**Enron Exercise**: come up with some kind of art-based response to the Enron Email Dataset. Keep in mind the below points of consideration.  



**GROUP A:** trace conversations from an inconspicuous email to something explicitly criminal. Perform it or put it into a piece of art? Tracing the conversations. Following the threads of an email. 

**GROUP B:** Tallying the number of times "best" and "sincerely" are signed off in an email. Irony, "hello" vs "to whom this may concern", levels of detachment. Creating a mobile of rankings in the company, check the balance. Ethnography, symbols of meaning. 

**GROUP C:** The exact same thing as group bâ€”> looking at the formality of the emails (specifically those tied to crimes vs those who aren't). Sentiment analysis for different times during the company's lifetime, overall emotions/feel of company (mapping ranks, events, frequency of emails sent during these events)

**GROUP D:** Ransomware! Take random quotes from the emails and form them together to make a play, including a photocopied monologue. Mixed in are selected suspicious quotes, source of everything flashing up on the screen.  







how will you present? 







There are (sort of) **three** ways/points at which you can consider a dataset. 

1. **Collection** - considering the terms of collection of some data, or collecting your own data, or pointing our how something was collected. Aggregation
2. **Analysis** - once you have a dataset (or you've created one) looking at what it represents, or doing statistical operations, or doing something to it. 
3. **Use/Effects** - what about the data you show, putting in or out of context
   1. visualizations
   2. manifestations 
   3. models
   4. programs, algorithms
