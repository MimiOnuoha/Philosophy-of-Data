# Week Five

**How do we respond?**

- data and/or data art and/or data viz and/or data manifestations/representations 
- what are our intentions with the work we create? 



Note your thoughts and responses to the pieces. What appealed to you the most? The least? What worked, what didn't? 



## Reading Responses

- The more interesting part is the information you get from data - that's where the art is. When you turn it into something visual, you lose that 

- More a problem of design (made more visually interesting); not intriguing

- Data feelings - data as humanizing  

- Taking something useless and turning it into something cool, interesting, etc (3d printed, physical things)

- Data viz as more than just charts, graphs 

- It could be anything? The relation needs substance â€” do we need a direct correlation? What is the end goal? 

- Museum of Feelings (getting the general mood of a city) - data that reflects you/your city 

- state of the union [structuralist perspective, levi-strauss, binaries]

- right to be forgotten -scraping blogs, social media, preserving them in an art project 

  - is it okay because it's art?
  - is it okay because it's anonymous?

- does it need to prove a point?
