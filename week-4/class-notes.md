# The web as (data) source

## Web scraping 


<strong>What are all of the datapoints on Facebook or Instagram?</strong>

aka 

What actions do you do that give data to Facebook or Instagram?

Is it a problem that Facebook knows all this information about us?

- should we get a cut of the money that's made off of our data? (consumer + product)
-  is this only okay if we know exactly what it is that they know? 
- what happens to our data if Facebook goes away? 
- Maybe it doesn't matter? 
	- contextualized? 
- if it mattered that much, couldn't we just leave?
	- how much of an option do we have? 
- what is it being used for? 
- How big of a problem is it? 
- do we even know what we're giving up at the time that we get facebook? 
- the conundrum of privacy policies 
- will this change public office (and other spaces?) 
- legislation isn't keeping up with technology?
	- (it's illegal to be )
- if we all have our data online, are we 
- will the web still be around in 30 years? 
- Facebook as our oxygen - changing the way that we operate (timelessness + shorter timespan)
- how will it change to have an exact record of everything we've all done? (things that live longer than we will)
- this has happened before--> writing, printing press, etc etc etc
