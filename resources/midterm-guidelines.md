# Midterm 

We've spent the last five weeks talking about different weeks talking about the implications, effects, failings, benefits, and trade-offs of data collection. For your midterm, you have to come up with an original idea and compelling  proof-of-concept that responds to any one of the issues, examples, topics, or work that we have discussed in class. 

You will work in groups of 2 and 3. You do not have to have a completely working project, but you do have to have a functioning prototype that speaks to the larger concept with which you are engaging. (For example, think about how [Autonomous Trap 001](jamesbridle.com/works/autonomous-trap-001) isn't *actually* created with a self-driving car, but still functions as powerful commentary on the topic). 

You have to present something. It can be a website, a program, an object, an intervention, a print, an app, etc etc. Be creative, and take inspiration from the projects that we have looked at and exercises that we have done in class. What has resonated with you most? 

Be prepared to present your project on **October 17th**. Projects will be judged based on the depth of effort, research, implementation, and critical consideration behind them. For final projects you must also publish a post on your website or on github about the project.
