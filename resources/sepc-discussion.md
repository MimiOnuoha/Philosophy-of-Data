# Questions for SEPC Discussion

1. More readings = more work for you outside of class, but more interesting material for you to be exposed to and for us to have to respond to inside class. Do you want a heavier or lighter reading workload? 

   ​

   ​

2. How much time outside of class, if any, are those of you who have not programmed before spending on learning programming outside of class?

   ​

   ​

3. Because our class concerns both conceptual and technical ideas, we constantly have to wrestle with balance. As of now, we try and split how much time we spend on discussions/exercises and programming. Would you prefer this to be skewed more in one direction or another? If so, which one? 

   ​

   ​

4. So far, the class has struck a balance between group and individual assignments, as both provide different advantages and opportunities. Collectively, do you appreciate switching between the two, or do you find yourself learning more through one specific approach? (Looking for a majority consensus/opinion, and if you are all leaning towards one of these, please include why.)
