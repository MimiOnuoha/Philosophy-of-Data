# Final: Philosophy of Data

We've spent the entire semester diving into the realities of our quantified society, ongoing mass data collection, our increasing reliance on algorithms, the conditions that have gone into creating this, and the implications, effects, failings, benefits, and trade-offs of all of these things, individually and combined.

For your final, you will be tasked with responding to any of the things that we have talked about in the duration of the course. Like the midterm, you will have to come up with an original idea, but unlike the midterm, you need to have something greater than a proof-of-concept. You must have a working prototype, something that you can show as a finished piece that stands on its own. 

The medium that your work takes should be in alignment with the project that you're doing. Your project may involve a great deal of web scraping or  data collection in some form, but you still have to consider what the audience sees: what is the output? Think carefully about this. 

At it's best, media art is implicitly involved in approaching a topic and making ti visible, understandably, playful, imaginative, speculative, or the like. Challenge yourself, work on something that is meaningful to or for you. You will have three weeks to work on this project, so as long as you come up with your idea early, Anna and I can provide the technical help that you need for implementation. 

Be prepared to present your project in front of a panel of guest critics on the last day of class (**December 12th**). Projects will be judged based on the depth of effort, research, implementation, and critical consideration behind them. For final projects you must also publish a post on your website or on github about the project; this will also be due on 12/12.
