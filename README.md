## Course Description 

We live in a world where more data has been and is being collected than ever before. But what does that mean? What information can we glean from the data? How do we represent what is being collected, and more importantly, what is missed?

This intro-level course examines the emergent fields of data collection, analysis, and visualization from an art perspective, asking how the technologies inherent to each can be leveraged for response, creation, and critique.

This course is equal parts technical (programming-based) and conceptual (writing/reading/discussion). Students will learn the basics of data gathering and analysis with the programming language Python, as well as learn to create data visualizations and manifestations using various computational tools. In addition, students will be introduced to the technical ways in which data is stored, collected, and consumed, as well as gain an understanding of the historical and critical positioning of the current â€œdata revolution."

## Expectations and Requirements
- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments + accompanying blogposts 
- Midterm and final project (completed individually or in groups) + online documentation

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, secual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible. 



## Evaluation
Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, blogposts, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. 

For homework assignments, it is more important that you put forth effort and attempts to understand and experiment with the material than it is for you to create a 100% successful project (particularly for first-time coders). Everyone gets one free pass for turning in an assignment late, but only one. 

For the midterm and final projects, I am more interested in what you choose to do than in what you can do. We will eleaborate on these distinctions in class. 


## Format 
The course will cover a number of different themes that intersect with issues of data collection. Because each theme consists of both a technical and conceptual idea, most themes will span two weeks. 

Each class will have the same structure: the first portion of class will be devoted to reviewing homework. The next will consist of a critical reading, viewing, or discussion. The last will consist of a coding exercise or technical workshop (I will screen-record the technical sections of class so that you can refer to them outside of class). The portions of class devoted to each of these will differ depending on the week. 

For some weeks, there will be additional links and resources provided. It is not necessary for you to look at these, however, it would certainly be interesting to look at them and think through connections to the subject matter of the class.

Though we will meet in a lab that has computers, it may be beneficial to bring your laptop with you to class. 

I can be reached via email at all times, but I am very slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I reserve 24 hours to respond, but typically will reply much sooner. 

## Syllabus
**Week One: September 5**    
Introductions to course, logistics, data, and each other

*Assignment:*

- Read through [this](http://rwet.decontextualize.com/book/unix/) up until the section that begins with "Structure of UNIX commands". If you're feeling ambitious, you can follow along and try some of the commands. 
- Read Maciej Ceglowski's ["The Internet With A Human Face"](http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm) 
- Write  a 300-500 word entry about your thoughts on Ceglowski's piece or anything we talked about in class. What has stood out to you about this so far? What interests you about data collection and implications of networked society? You can write anything, but you must post to your new blog and submit the URL of the blogpost using the homework link (see above). 
- Bonus: Change the about page of your website and the links on the navigation bar at the top. Check the README file to see how to do this. 


**Week Two: September 12**  
*Archives, Collections, Memory, part 1*   
Data begins with storage, collection, memory.   
[Fundamentals of programming in Python]

**Week Three: September 19**      
*Archives, Collections, Memory, part 2*   

**Week Four: September 26**  
*Web Scraping and the World As Computer*  
Considering the world as a data source.    
[Scraping web data] 

**Week Five: October 3**  
*Web Scraping and the World As Computer, part 2*  
[Working with APIs]

**Week Six: October 10**  
*Aesthetic and Representations, physical and digital*   
Shifting from acquiring data to considering how we can begin to represent it. We are only as good as our representations of the world, so how should we relate to them? 

**Week Seven: October 17**    
*Midterm Presentations*

**Week Eight: October 24**   
*Quantification and Surveillance, part 1*    
What does it mean to render ourselves as datapoints? How do we carry out, and what is achieved, through self-quantification?    
[Programmatic self-tracking in Python]

**Week Nine: October 31**   
*Quantification and Surveillance, part 2*   
We are increasingly living in a surveillance state, and data plays a crucial role in facilitating it. What are technical avenues for response, resistance, and complicity? 


**Week Ten: November 7**  
*Guest presentations or field trip--TBA*

**Week Eleven: November 14**  
*Plan Day--No Class*

**Week Twelve: November 28**  
*Missing Things and Uncertainty*  
The most important decision of any dataset is what you decide to leave out. Who gets to decide, and how do we visualize things that are missing? 


**Week Thirteen: December 5**  
*Futures: Speculation, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence*


**Week Fourteen: December 12**   
*Final Project Presentations*
