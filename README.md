## Course Description 

We live in a world where more data has been and is being collected than ever before. But what does that mean? What information can we glean from the data? How do we represent what is being collected, and more importantly, what is missed?

This intro-level course examines the emergent fields of data collection, analysis, and visualization from an art perspective, asking how the technologies inherent to each can be leveraged for response, creation, and critique.

This course is equal parts technical (programming-based) and conceptual (writing/reading/discussion). Students will learn the basics of data gathering and analysis with the programming language Python, as well as learn to create data visualizations and manifestations using various computational tools. In addition, students will be introduced to the technical ways in which data is stored, collected, and consumed, as well as gain an understanding of the historical and critical positioning of the current â€œdata revolution."

## Expectations and Requirements
- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments + accompanying blogposts 
- Midterm and final project (completed individually or in groups) + online documentation

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible. 



## Evaluation
Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, blogposts, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. 

For homework assignments, it is more important that you put forth effort and attempts to understand and experiment with the material than it is for you to create a 100% successful project (particularly for first-time coders). Everyone gets one free pass for turning in an assignment late, but only one. 

For the midterm and final projects, I am more interested in what you choose to do than in what you can do. We will eleaborate on these distinctions in class. 


## Format 
The course will cover a number of different themes that intersect with issues of data collection. Because each theme consists of both a technical and conceptual idea, most themes will span two weeks. 

Each class will have the same structure: the first portion of class will be devoted to reviewing homework. The next will consist of a critical reading, viewing, or discussion. The last will consist of a coding exercise or technical workshop (I will screen-record the technical sections of class so that you can refer to them outside of class). The portions of class devoted to each of these will differ depending on the week. 

For some weeks, there will be additional links and resources provided. It is not necessary for you to look at these, however, it would certainly be interesting to look at them and think through connections to the subject matter of the class.

Though we will meet in a lab that has computers, it may be beneficial to bring your laptop with you to class. 

I can be reached via email at all times, but I am very slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I reserve 24 hours to respond, but typically will reply much sooner. 

## Syllabus
**Week One: September 5**    
Introductions to course, logistics, data, and each other

*Assignment:*

- Read through [this](http://rwet.decontextualize.com/book/unix/) up until the section that begins with "Structure of UNIX commands". If you're feeling ambitious, you can follow along and try some of the commands. 
- Read Maciej Ceglowski's ["The Internet With A Human Face"](http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm) 
- Write  a 300-500 word entry about your thoughts on Ceglowski's piece or anything we talked about in class. What has stood out to you about this so far? What interests you about data collection and implications of networked society? You can write anything, but you must post to your new blog and submit the URL of the blogpost using the homework link (see above). 
- Bonus: Change the about page of your website and the links on the navigation bar at the top. Check the README file to see how to do this. 


**Week Two: September 12**  
*Archives, Collections, Memory, part 1: A World Remembered*   
Data begins with storage, collection, memory. In this class, we'll talk about what that storage looks like physically, how we reconcile with a world where (nearly) everything can be saved, and what forms data can take. Technical exercise:  introduction to the command line via git.  

*Assignment:*

- Read through [this](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz). What do you think about this? Do you think Stephens-Davidowitz is right that Google searches reveal who we most are? Write a 200-400 word response on your blog. Don't forget to submit the URL using the homework link (see above).
- Practice using the command line with Unix commands. See if you can figure out what the following commands do: `top`, `echo hello world`, `who am i`, `ls -a`, `uname -a`, `cal 03 2156`
- Also figure out how to use the chmod and cat commands. I won't teach this in class, so if we end up needing them I will assume you know what they do. 

BONUS: If you want, you can read Derrida's Archive Fever. We won't have time to cover it in class, but it's a classic (it can be found in the "readings" folder). 


**Week Three: September 19**      
*Archives, Collections, Memory, part 2: Deleting, Erasing, Removing*   
[Fundamentals of programming in Python]</br>This week's [screen recording](https://youtu.be/pcaMNvcVIWY).

*Assignment:*

- Read [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/technology/personaltech/right-to-be-forgotten-online-is-poised-to-spread.html?mcubz=1). Do you think that the right to be forgotten and a right to information are at odds with each other? Post a response.
- Use Python to do something interesting with the browser search terms from one of the files. This doesn't have to be fancy or complicated (but can absolutely be both if you have the skillset), but you should try to make use of some [list operations](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm),[string operations](https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-string-methods/), and/or a for loop. Maybe you want to replace words, or print out certain ones, or make a haiku out of something, etc. Post your code online on your blog or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) on Github and include the link in your site. 
- Your website entry this week should include the documentation/code for what you did, and your reactions to the article. Do you feel any  differently towards browser search terms after all we've done this week?  

*Note*:  For those of you generally interested in seeing your Google search history, you can follow [these](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?visit_id=1-636414631927975304-4169243852&rd=2) instructions. They won't take the format of the ones that we worked with in class, but you can still begin to see what types of things you've been searching for. 


**Week Four: September 26**  
*Web Scraping and the World As Computer*  
Considering the world as a data source.    

*Assignment:*  
Here is the homework that everyone needs to do:

- Read Mitchell Whitelaw's ["Art Against Information"](http://eleven.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-067-art-against-information-case-studies-in-data-practice/)
- With your partner(s), **extend the program that you were working on in class.** Come up with an interesting exercise that involves scraping the web. Maybe you want to scrape all the images from a site, or do a word frequency analysis of all of the content from a story. You have to use beautifulsoup and html, but you can do whatever you want specifically. 
- Include in your site post what you wanted to do, the code that you eventually wrote, and whether it succeeded or not. Only **one** of you has to  publish the post, but you should work on it all together. When you submit it include both/all of your names.

And here is additional work for if you are feeling lost about the stuff we did in class:


- Do the first eight exercises of [Learn Python The Hard Way ](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html). For the first exercise, you can skip the setup and start at the part called "Finding Things on the Internet". You don't have to pay to read these, just click the "Next Lesson" button on the bottom right of each page. 
- Now learn about functions [here](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions).

If you are struggling with your code: read your error messages, search StackOverflow, drop by and see Anna, or shoot me an email.

**Week Five: October 3**  

*Aesthetic and Representations, physical and digital*   

How do we respond to the landscape we're in? We are only as good as our representations of the world, so how should we relate to them? 

*Assignment:*  

- Your only assignment this week is to begin working on your midterm project. Meet with your partner(s) to decide on what you want to do for it. Be ready to talk about your idea in class next week, and consult the midterm prompt in the resources folder if you have any questions. 
- Post an overview of your midterm idea on your blog, and submit it using the homework form. 

**Week Six: October 10**  
*Python review and working on midterms* 

*Assignment:*

Your only assignment is to work on your midterms! Consult the midterm guideline document in the resources folder 

**Week Seven: October 17**    
*Midterm Presentations*

**Week Eight: October 24**   
*Self-quantification*    
What does it mean to render ourselves as datapoints? How do we carry out, and what is achieved, through self-quantification?    
[Programmatic self-tracking in Python]

**Week Nine: October 31**   
*Surveillance*   
We are increasingly living in a surveillance state, and data plays a crucial role in facilitating it. What are technical avenues for response, resistance, and complicity? 

**Week Ten: November 7**  
*Guest presentations or field trip--TBA*

**Week Eleven: November 14**  
*Plan Day--No Class*

**Week Twelve: November 28**  
*Missing Things and Uncertainty*  
The most important decision of any dataset is what you decide to leave out. Who gets to decide, and how do we visualize things that are missing? 


**Week Thirteen: December 5**  
*Futures: Speculation, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence*


**Week Fourteen: December 12**   
*Final Project Presentations*
